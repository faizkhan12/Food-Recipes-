        <li>Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion, grate 3 garlic cloves, peel and grate a 1-inch piece of ginger; place it all in a medium bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin in a large bowl. Combine 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin, and a pinch of cayenne pepper if desired in a small bowl and set aside. Cut 2 pounds chicken into 1-inch pieces, add to the spices in the large bowl, season with kosher salt and black pepper, and toss to evenly coat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate; it might not be cooked through.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the onion mixture to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved spices, 1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick, and 1 tablespoon tomato paste, and cook 1 minute more.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the can of tomato sauce, 1 1/4 cups water, and the chicken and any accumulated juices, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the sauce slightly thickens and the chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, chop 2 tablespoons cilantro.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add 1/2 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice to the chicken, and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt as needed. Garnish with the cilantro and serve over basmati rice or with naan.</p></li>
    </ol>
